Getting started
----
1. Install Android SDK (android-sdk-update-manager) using your distro
1. Run `tools/android` executable (probably needs root)
  * from "Tools" section check "Android SDK Tools", "Android Platform-tools", "Android SDK Build-tools"
  * from the section "Android 5.1.1 (API 21)" check "SDK Platform"
  * uncheck everything else or you'll waste your drive with unneeded stuff
  * Install - Accept License - Install
  * add paths to `tools` and `platform-tools` directories to your PATH environment variable
1. Connect your Android device with USB-cable and run `adb devices`
  * observe your device in the list and accept "Allow USB debugging" that appears on your device
  * if you don't see your device in the listâ€”you need to enable Developer Options on your device (just Google how to do that for your device)
1. Install sbt, scala and icedtea (JDK) using your distro
1. Run `scala` to make sure that you're running the correct version of JVM (it should be OpenJDK); exit it
1. Run `./configure.sh` (the first run can take about 20 minutes to download all the dependencies to ~/.ivy2 directory)
1. From `sbt` command prompt you can
  * `eclipse` to generate eclipse project
  * `test`
  * `run` to compile and run on the device
